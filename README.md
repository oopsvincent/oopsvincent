## 🧭 About Me

I’m Farhan Ali Reza - a web developer and systems thinker focused on building long-term, human-centered digital products.  
My current focus is **Rhythmé**, a platform designed to integrate habits, clarity, and personal growth into a meaningful daily system.

I’m driven by:
- structured thinking  
- clean and intentional design  
- long-term product vision  
- disciplined execution  

My work blends frontend engineering, product thinking, and a deep interest in how people interact with tools that shape their lives.

## 🚀 What I’m Building

- **Rhythmé** — a human-centered productivity and well-being ecosystem  
- **GrooveEstrella** — an upcoming platform focused on music systems (built last year, will continue again from next year)  
- A long-term, multi-product ecosystem under a unified company vision  

I’m working toward establishing a technology brand that builds systems—not just apps.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

I work primarily with:

- **TypeScript / JavaScript**  
- **React / Next.js**  
- **Tailwind CSS**  
- **Node.js**  
- **C# / Unity** (past experience)  
- **Design Systems & UI Engineering**

I care more about **clarity, structure, and maintainability** than chasing the newest framework.
